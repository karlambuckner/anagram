# _Anagram Checker_

#### _First week Epicodus Ruby code review, Sep 8, 2017_

#### By _**Karla Buckner**_

## Description

_This is a Ruby script for determining if two words are anagrams, palindromes or antigrams. Two strings are considered anagrams if the contain the same letters. Two strings are considered palindromes if they are the same forward as they are backwards. Two strings are considered antigrams if they don't share any common letters._

## Specifications

_1. Checks that both words include vowels in order to be words
  *Example input: ("hkjl", "fmlp" Example output: "Please enter a real word"
2. Takes two words and compares the characters to determine if they are anagrams

  Example input: ("ate","eat") Example output: "This is an anagram"
3. Compares two words to determine an anagram regardless of case

  Example input: ("Rat", "tar")  Example output: "This is an anagram"
4. Checks if words are also palindromes regardless of case

  Example input: ("Anna", "anna")  Example output: "This is also a palindrome"
5. Checks if both words are instead antigrams

  Example input: ("work", "jump")  Example output: "No letter match, not an anagram"
6. Checks if multiple words or a phrase are anagrams or antigrams

  Example input: "book worm", "cat love"  Example output: "This is an antigram"_
